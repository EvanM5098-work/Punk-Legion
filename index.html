            <p class="intro-message">We are a group of friends, gaming <em>"buddies"</em> if you will. The majority of us started 
                on Playstation, moved around a bit but ended up back on Playstation 4.
            Unlike most gaming groups, we do not aim to go <em>"Pro".</em>
            We are simply here to enjoy gaming as it was meant to be enjoyed, with friends!
            Our youngest member and also the Co-Founder of the group <strong>Luhann Marais</strong>
            is the brother of the Leader/Founder, <strong>Evan Marais</strong>.
            both of them are driven by gaming and the leader, even created <strong>this</strong> webpage dedicated solely to the group
            and his love for gaming. With the new <em>Playstation 5</em> quickly approaching,
            we as a group, are extremely excited to see where this new Generation takes us!</p>
